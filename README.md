## Controls

### Playback

- **Play**: Start playing selected song
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggle pause state
- **Stop**: Stop playback
- **Progress Bar**: Click or drag to seek to specific position

### Play Modes

- **Sequential**: Play songs in order
- **Loop**: Repeat current track
- **Shuffle**: Play random songs from entire library

### Other

- **Browse**: Change songs directory
- **Scan Now**: Manually trigger directory rescan
- **Search**: Filter songs by title, artist, or album
- **Min length**: Set minimum duration threshold (in seconds)
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Escape**: Toggle fullscreen/windowed mode

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your osu! Songs directory at:
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\osu!\Songs
```

You can change this by clicking the "Browse..." button.

### Minimum Duration

By default, songs shorter than 30 seconds are excluded. You can adjust this in the UI or by modifying `MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` in `config.py`.

### Cache Location

Song metadata is cached at:
```
~/.osu_mp3_browser_cache.json
```

This speeds up subsequent launches by avoiding re-scanning all files.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Escape**: Toggle between maximized and windowed mode
- **Enter** (in min length field): Apply new duration filter
- **Double-click** (on song): Play selected song

## Troubleshooting

### Audio doesn't play

- Ensure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
- Check that your audio files are in supported formats (.mp3, .ogg)

### No songs appear

- Verify your osu! Songs directory exists and contains beatmaps
- Click "Scan Now" to manually trigger a rescan
- Check the console for error messages

### Thumbnails don't show

- Install Pillow: `pip install pillow`
- Ensure .osu files contain valid background image references

### Metadata is missing

- Install mutagen for better tag extraction: `pip install mutagen`
- Some metadata may be parsed from folder names as fallback
